# AgentOperatingSystem
An operating system of agents
Top level agents generate natural language actions from purpose, domain knowledge, and environmental inputs.

Down the line agents would take actions

Prerequisites:
  - Fine-tuned, domain-specific models exposed as API endpoints (see FineTunedLLM repo for details)
  - Azure OpenAI Service subscription and access credentials
  - Access to Copilot Studio

-----------------------------------------------------------
Configure Copilot Studio for Perpetually Running Agent Orchestration
Perpetually running agents configured in Copilot Studio that orchestrate queries to the appropriate endpoints
-----------------------------------------------------------

## Access and Setup in Copilot Studio
- Log in to Copilot Studio with your organizational credentials.
- Create a new project dedicated to multi-agent orchestration, naming it according to your domain or business function.
- Configure the project for “always-on” operation, ensuring agents remain active and responsive at all times.
- Set up project-level environment variables and secrets for secure integration with Azure OpenAI endpoints.

## Design Persistent Agent Workflows
- For each domain-specific task (e.g., answering FAQs, processing orders), design a custom agent using Copilot Studio’s visual workflow editor.
- Implement a continuous event loop within each agent so it can listen for and respond to incoming events or queries indefinitely.
- Enable persistent session support to maintain conversational context across multiple interactions.
- Integrate heartbeat or keep-alive mechanisms to monitor agent health and automatically recover from transient failures.

## Integrate with Azure OpenAI Endpoints
- For each agent, input the connection details (API endpoint, authentication keys) of the corresponding fine-tuned model.
- Define routing logic so the agent can:
  - Continuously poll for new events or remain responsive to triggers (e.g., webhooks, message queues).
  - Analyze the context of each query and select the appropriate Azure OpenAI endpoint for processing.
  - Format and store responses, maintaining state for multi-turn or context-rich interactions as needed.

## Enhance Resilience and Error Handling
- Implement robust error-handling routines to gracefully manage API failures, timeouts, or invalid responses.
- Set up logging within each agent to capture errors, operational metrics, and health signals for monitoring and troubleshooting.
- Integrate auto-recovery steps, such as self-reset or process restarts, to ensure agents can recover from unexpected issues.
- Optionally, connect agents to Azure messaging services (e.g., Service Bus, Event Grid) for asynchronous event processing and improved scalability.

## Continuous Validation and Iterative Refinement
- Use Copilot Studio’s built-in testing tools to simulate long-running sessions and validate agent behavior under various scenarios.
- Ensure agents reliably maintain context, correctly route queries, and handle high volumes of requests.
- Collect feedback from testing and real-world usage to iteratively refine agent workflows, state management, and error recovery strategies.
- Thoroughly document workflow configurations, state variables, and error-handling mechanisms to support ongoing maintenance and future enhancements.
