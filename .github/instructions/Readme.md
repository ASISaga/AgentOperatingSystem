# Agent Operating System - Copilot Agent Onboarding Guide

Welcome to the Agent Operating System (AOS) repository! This guide will help you quickly understand and work effectively with this codebase.

## 🎯 What is This Repository?

**Agent Operating System (AOS)** is a production-ready operating system for AI agents, built on Microsoft Azure and the Microsoft Agent Framework. The key architectural difference from traditional AI orchestration frameworks is **PERSISTENCE** - agents are perpetual entities that run indefinitely, not temporary task-based sessions.

### Core Concept: Perpetual vs Task-Based
- Traditional frameworks: Temporary sessions that start, execute, and terminate
- AOS: Perpetual agents that register once and run indefinitely, awakening on events
- State persists across the agent's entire lifetime via ContextMCPServer

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.8+
- **Platform**: Microsoft Azure (Functions, Service Bus, Storage, etc.)
- **Framework**: Microsoft Agent Framework
- **Async**: Asyncio for concurrent operations
- **Testing**: pytest with pytest-asyncio
- **Dependencies**: See pyproject.toml

## 📋 Development Workflow

### Setup
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -e ".[full]"  # Install with all optional dependencies
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_perpetual_agents.py

# Run with verbose output
pytest -v tests/

# Run async tests (most tests use async/await)
pytest tests/ -v --asyncio-mode=auto
```

### Code Quality
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints where possible
- Write async functions for I/O operations
- Use meaningful variable names

### Common Commands
```bash
# Run a specific test
pytest tests/test_integration.py -v

# Check Python syntax
python -m py_compile src/AgentOperatingSystem/agents/*.py

# List all test files
find tests/ -name "test_*.py"
```

## 🔑 Key Concepts & Patterns

### 1. Perpetual Agents
Agents in AOS run indefinitely, not as one-off tasks:
```python
from AgentOperatingSystem.agents import PerpetualAgent

agent = PerpetualAgent(agent_id="ceo", adapter_name="ceo")
manager.register_agent(agent)  # Registers once, runs forever
```

### 2. Purpose-Driven Agents
The fundamental building block, combining perpetual operation with purpose alignment:
```python
from AgentOperatingSystem.agents import PurposeDrivenAgent

agent = PurposeDrivenAgent(
    agent_id="ceo",
    purpose="Strategic oversight and company growth",
    purpose_scope="Strategic planning, major decisions",
    success_criteria=["Revenue growth", "Team expansion"],
    adapter_name="ceo"
)
```

### 3. Async/Await Everywhere
Most AOS code is asynchronous:
```python
async def example():
    await agent.initialize()
    result = await agent.process_event(event)
    await agent.cleanup()
```

### 4. Azure Integration
AOS heavily uses Azure services:
- Azure Functions for deployment
- Azure Service Bus for messaging
- Azure Storage (Blob, Table, Queue) for persistence
- Azure Key Vault for secrets

### 5. MCP (Model Context Protocol)
AOS implements MCP for tool and resource access:
- `src/AgentOperatingSystem/mcp/` - MCP implementation
- ContextMCPServer for state preservation

```

### Writing Tests
- Use `pytest.mark.asyncio` for async tests
- Follow existing test patterns in the tests/ directory
- Mock Azure services when appropriate
- Test both success and failure cases

## 🚨 Common Gotchas & Best Practices

### Async/Await
- **Always** use `await` for async functions
- Use `asyncio.run()` for running async code from sync context
- Be careful with event loops in tests

### Azure Services
- Many features require Azure credentials (set in environment or local.settings.json)
- Some tests may be skipped if Azure services are not available
- Use mock services for local testing when possible

### Dependencies
- Install with `[full]` option for all features: `pip install -e ".[full]"`
- Optional dependency groups: `azure`, `ml`, `mcp`
- Some tests may require specific dependencies

### State Management
- Agents maintain state via ContextMCPServer
- State persists across events (perpetual nature)
- Clean up state in tests to avoid cross-test contamination

### Error Handling
- Use try/except blocks for Azure service calls
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- Log errors with structured logging

## 📚 Learning Path

## 💡 Tips for Efficient Work

1. **Use grep/search**: This is a large codebase. Use grep to find relevant code:
   ```bash
   grep -r "PurposeDrivenAgent" src/
   find src/ -name "*orchestr*.py"
   ```

2. **Check examples first**: Before implementing something, check if there's an example in `examples/`

3. **Read tests**: Tests are often the best documentation for how to use a feature

4. **Start small**: Make minimal changes to achieve your goal

5. **Async is key**: Remember that almost everything is async. Use `await` liberally

6. **Azure context**: Many features are Azure-specific. Understand the Azure service being used

7. **State is persistent**: Remember that agents are perpetual and maintain state

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: How do I run tests?**
A: `pytest tests/` - Most tests are async and use pytest-asyncio

**Q: What Python version is required?**
A: Python 3.8 or higher (see pyproject.toml)

**Q: How do I install dependencies?**
A: `pip install -e ".[full]"` for all features, or `pip install -e .` for core only

**Q: Why are agents "perpetual"?**
A: Unlike traditional frameworks where agents run for a task then stop, AOS agents register once and run indefinitely, responding to events. This is the core architectural difference.

**Q: What is PurposeDrivenAgent?**
A: It's the fundamental building block of AOS, combining perpetual operation with purpose alignment and using ContextMCPServer for state preservation.

**Q: How do I test Azure Functions locally?**
A: Use the Azure Functions Core Tools, but many tests use mocks for local testing

**Q: What if tests fail due to missing Azure credentials?**
A: Many tests will skip or mock Azure services if credentials are not available. For full testing, configure Azure credentials in local.settings.json

**Remember**: This is an operating system for AI agents, not a traditional application. Think in terms of persistent processes, event-driven architecture, and long-running state, not request-response or task-based execution.
