# AgentOperatingSystem Implementation

AgentOperatingSystem is built using multiple domain specific, PurposeDrivenAgent(s), operating perpetually, just like daemons of a compute operating system.

## Architecture Overview

The AgentOperatingSystem (AOS) provides a framework for managing and coordinating multiple AI agents to work together as a cohesive system. It mirrors traditional operating system concepts by implementing:

- **Agent Daemons**: Perpetually running agents that operate continuously in the background
- **Agent Teams**: Coordinated groups of specialized agents working collaboratively
- **Resource Management**: Efficient allocation of computational resources across agents
- **Inter-Agent Communication**: Standardized messaging protocols for agent coordination
- **Shared Memory System**: Centralized knowledge store for agent collaboration

## Core Components

### 1. PerpetualAgent Class

The `PerpetualAgent` serves as the foundation for daemon-like agents that operate continuously:

```python
class PerpetualAgent(AssistantAgent):
    def __init__(self, tools, system_message):
        super().__init__(
            name="PerpetualAgent", 
            model_client=self.model_client, 
            tools=tools, 
            system_message=system_message
        )
```

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Asynchronous Operation**: Utilizes asyncio for non-blocking execution
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Operates indefinitely, responding to triggers and events
- **Tool Integration**: Supports custom tools for specialized functionality
- **Model Client Integration**: Uses OpenAI Chat Completion Client for LLM interactions

**Implementation Features:**
- Automatic error recovery and resilience mechanisms
- Configurable intervals for periodic task execution
- Health monitoring and heartbeat mechanisms
- Resource-efficient operation patterns

### 2. AgentTeam Framework

The `AgentTeam` class orchestrates multiple agents in collaborative workflows:

```python
from autogen_agentchat.teams import RoundRobinGroupChat
from autogen_agentchat.conditions import TextMessageTermination

# Create agent team with termination conditions
team = RoundRobinGroupChat(
    [perpetual_agent, coder_agent],
    termination_condition=termination_condition,
)
```

**Team Management Features:**
- **Round-Robin Execution**: Balanced task distribution among team members
- **Termination Conditions**: Configurable stopping criteria for team operations
- **Dynamic Agent Addition**: Runtime modification of team composition
- **Role-Based Coordination**: Agents assigned specific roles within teams

### 3. Integration with PurposeDrivenAgent Framework

The AOS leverages the PurposeDrivenAgent framework for specialized agent capabilities:

**Domain-Specific Agents:**
- **CoderAgent**: Autonomous code development and execution
- **KnowledgeAgent**: Information synthesis and retrieval
- **IntelligenceAgent**: Advanced reasoning and analysis
- **LearningAgent**: Continuous knowledge acquisition

**Purpose-Driven Architecture:**
- Each agent operates with a specific purpose that drives all decisions
- Dynamic domain knowledge generation based on agent purpose
- Continuous opportunity evaluation and action guidance
- Collaborative intelligence through agent networks

## Technical Implementation

### Configuration Management

The system uses a centralized configuration approach via `config.py`:

```python
# Azure OpenAI Configuration
azure_openai_model = "gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09"
azure_openai_endpoint = ""
azure_openai_key = ""
azure_openai_api_version = "2024-02-01"

# Amazon Bedrock Configuration
aws_region = "us-east-1"
bedrock_model_id = "anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0"
```

### Asynchronous Processing

All agent operations utilize Python's `asyncio` for:
